# This is a Python implementation of the script from mausberrycircuits.com.
# It appears to be using a blunt tactic of monitoring the GPIO port (polling
# every second from a bash script). Unless I'm crazy, it's better to use
# interrupts here.
#
# The purpose of this script is to shut down the system gracefully when a
# button is pressed. This, combined with the Mausberry Circuits add-on switch,
# allows for safe startup and shutdown of the Raspberry Pi with the push of a
# button. It runs as a daemon on startup.
